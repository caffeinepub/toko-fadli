  "summary": "Backend and frontend were extended to include product tiers and added pricing utilities, a migration, and UI/editor hooks. However, required backend tier validation (unique qty, qty>0, price>=0) is not evidenced, and the backend Option-B pricing propagation into cart/transactions/receipt cannot be confirmed due to truncation. Some unrelated frontend changes appear (Transactions page behavior/filters, currency formatting helper).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend validates that tier quantities are > 0, tier prices are >= 0, and tier quantities are unique per product.",
      "reason": "The backend function shown (`validateAndSortTiers`) only sorts tiers; no checks for quantity > 0, price >= 0, or uniqueness are present in the diff excerpt.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "When addToCart is called, lineTotal is computed as tier.totalPrice if quantity matches an existing tier.qty; otherwise lineTotal is computed as product.price * quantity; Cart.totalAmount sums lineTotals; Checkout/receipt/Transaction items reflect calculated unitPrice/lineTotal.",
      "reason": "Although helper `findMatchingTier` exists, the `addToCart` implementation and any checkout/transaction persistence logic are truncated, so the required calculations and propagation to stored transactions/receipts are not confirmable from the provided diff summary.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added Indonesian Rupiah formatting helper and currency formatting utilities.",
      "reason": "Not requested by any requirement; pricing utilities requested were about tier validation/normalization and Option B calculation, not formatting.",

    {
      "description": "Transactions page enhancements: date range filtering and automatic navigation to latest receipt based on query param.",
